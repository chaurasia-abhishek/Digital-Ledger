# Digital-Ledger
Digital Ledger is a website to store notes digitally. Here user can Signup/login and can create, read, update and delete notes.It's my first full stack project. I used React, Font-awesome and Bootstrap in frontend and in backend I used Express.js and Node.js. for database I used Mongo.
